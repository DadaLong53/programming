[2]After installing the above software, clone this repo:

$ git clone git@github.com:OWASP/railsgoat.git

NOTE: NOT NECESSARY IF YOU WANT TO WORK WITH RAILS 5. Otherwise, if you wish to use the Rails 3 or 4 versions, you'll need to switch branches:

$ cd railsgoat
$ git checkout rails_3_2
$ git checkout rails_4_2

Navigate into the directory (already there if you followed the previous step) and install the dependencies:

$ bundle install

If you receive an error, make sure you have bundler installed:

$ gem install bundler

Initialize the database:

$ rails db:setup

Start the Thin web server:

$ rails server

Open your favorite browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000 and start hacking!


===============================================================
Docker Install
To run Railsgoat with Docker you must first have Docker and Docker Compose installed. 
Once those dependencies are installed, cd into the Railsgoat directory where you've cloned the code and run. 
Rails requires Compose 1.6.0 or above and require a Docker Engine of version 1.10.0 or above.

#~/code/railsgoat
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose run web rails db:setup
$ docker-compose up
...
  Creating railsgoat_web_1
  Attaching to railsgoat_web_1
$
Once you see the preceeding message Railsgoat is running on your localhost on port 3000.

Open your favorite browser, navigate to http://<dockerIP>:3000 and start hacking! 
The Docker IP is usually 192.168.99.100. Run docker-machine env to verify.
